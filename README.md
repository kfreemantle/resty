## Project: RESTy

### Author: Kyle Freemantle

### Problem Domain  

- RESTy is an API testing tool that is browser agnostic, allowing us to run basic API connection tests from any device.

- Phase 1 involved refactoring initial code away from class based components to functions, and implementing basic scss styling.

- Phase 2 involved adding the useState hook in preparation to connect to live APIs.

- Phase 3 involves connecting RESTy to live APIs, focusing on GET requests.
